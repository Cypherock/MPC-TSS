# MPC-TSS (Multi-Party Computation based Threshold Signature Scheme) with Cypherock X1
This repository contains a working implementation of MPC processes designed to run inside of a [secure execution environment](https://github.com/Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware/blob/main/docs/device_provision_auth.md) of Cypherock X1. The implementation make use of the existing [Cypherock-PKI](https://github.com/Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware/blob/main/docs/device_provision_auth.md) within the [Cypherock ecosystem](https://github.com/Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware#cypherock_x1_wallet) ([official website](https://www.cypherock.com/)) to establish private and authentic secure channel with the parties to generate digital signatures. Further we have proposed an extension to the [BIP32 protocol](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) (`"Extended BIP32"`) with which after the one time initial setup any individual party would be able to generate verifiable group public keys without other parties required to come online. All the polynomials required in the signature phase are generated randomly and consumed within the signature phase itself.

The setting comprises of 3 sub-processes running independent MPC group sessions over the group of parties. These sub-process are:
1. DKG (Distributed Key Generation) <br/> Setup group account xpub
2. Extended BIP32 <br/> Generates child public keys for the group
3. Transaction signing <br/> Sign ECDSA based transactions
